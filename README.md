# Queries:
Simple Queries:

1. Retrieves the name and price of each flower from the "flowers" table. Flower names are then listed in order of highest to lowest price.

2. Creates a new variable that lists the revenue that each flower produces. This is done by joining the flower and order details tables using the respective foreign key and multiplying "flower price" from the flower table by "quantity" from the order details table.

3. Combines data from the "Orders" and "Customers" table through the customer_id column; listing the top three customers who have spent over $55. The customers shown are the companies "most valuebale customers."
